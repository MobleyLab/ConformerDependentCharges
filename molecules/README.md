# READ ME - Molecules used for this study

* Here, we supply `.sdf` files of all the molecules used for our study.
	* The following SDF files are taken from the Protein-Ligand-Benchmark (PLB) github repository used for partial charge generation studies. 
		* `PLB_hif2a.sdf`: PLB HIF2a ligands 
			* `PLB_hif2a_truncated.sdf`: manually truncated HIF2a molecules using the molecules from PLB
		* `PLB_tyk2.sdf`: PLB TYK2 ligands
		* `PLB_shp2.sdf`: PLB SHP2 ligands
		* `PLB_p38.sdf`: PLB P38a ligands
		* `PLB_ptp1b.sdf` PLB PTP1b ligands
	* The following SDF files are for the molecules used for Absolute Hydration Free Energy simulation studies.
		* `PLB_simulation_all.sdf`: The set of 15 molecules chosen from our 5 PLB benchmark systems to simulate
		* `PLB_simulation_subset.sdf`: The subset of 6 molecules from the set above chosen for further investigation using other partial charge generation methods or hardware.
