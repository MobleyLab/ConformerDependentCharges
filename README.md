# ConformerDependentCharges

Here we deposit the Supporting Information files for our paper "Evaluating the functional importance of conformer-dependent atomic partial charge assignment"

In our Supporting Information we include:
* `molecules/`: 
	* 3D structures of all the molecules used in our partial charge variability studies and absolute hydration free energy calculations
* `scripts/`: 
	* script used to generate partial charges from different random conformers for each molecule
	* script to calculate our partial charge variability metric "bond âˆ†q"
	* scripts to generate all the start files for our absolute hydration free energy calculations
* `simulations/`:
	* all absolute hydration free energy calculation start files
